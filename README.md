# SQL E-commerce Analysis

This project demonstrates basic SQL analysis on a sample e-commerce dataset.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Practice SQL querying on a relational dataset
- Calculate common business metrics using SQL
- Present a clear and simple SQL project on GitHub

## Dataset
The project uses a simplified e-commerce schema with the following tables:
- customers
- orders
- visits

The dataset is **synthetic** and created for learning and demonstration purposes.  
It does not represent real company data.

## Analysis Performed
The following analyses are included:
- Total number of orders
- Total revenue
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Customer-level order counts
- Visit and order relationships

## File Structure
- `schema.sql` → Table definitions
- `sample_queries.sql` → Basic SQL queries
- `analysis.sql` → Analytical queries
- `README.md` → Project documentation
